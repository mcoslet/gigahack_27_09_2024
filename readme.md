# FineGuide.ai Challenge
## Developed by Enjenir.ai

## Problem Description
Analysis of logs from AI Agents and create insightful reports, data was in multiple-language, so we standardise the language to `en`
and create topics and sentiment analysis

## Code structure
1. src.main.eda is the package related to all plots and visualise code
2. src.main.etl is the package related to all preprocessing and cleaning code
3. src.main.utils is the package related to all additional functions what help to follow DRY and KISS pattern


## Technologies
1. Pandas for data processing and cleaning
2. Seaborn and matplotlib for data visualise
3. OpenAI gpt-4o-mini model
4. WordLlama for NLP clustering


## For future
1. Unify the pipeline for data processing
2. Add visualisation code from Cristofor side
3. Improve translation capabilities
4. Add UI with streamlit
5. Implement export possibility for data report
