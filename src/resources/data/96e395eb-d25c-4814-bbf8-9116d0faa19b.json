For example:\n\n   ```html\n   <a href=\"https://www.example.com\">Click Here</a>\n   ```\n\n   This will turn the text \"Click Here\" into a clickable link.\n\n   For an image, it would look like:\n\n   ```html\n   <a href=\"https://www.example.com\"><img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Example Image\"></a>\n   ```\n\n5. **Customize the Link**: You can add additional attributes to the `<a>` tag to customize the link behavior, such as:\n\n   - `target=\"_blank\"` to open the link in a new tab\n   - `title=\"Link Title\"` to add hover text\n   - `style=\"...\"` to apply custom CSS styles\n\n6. **Save the HTML File**: Once you've added all the links, save the HTML file with your changes.\n\n7. **Re-import the Template**: Finally, import the updated HTML file back into Postcards to use the template with the new links.\n\nThis direct HTML editing approach gives you more granular control over the links in your email template.

Here’s a quick guide to ensure everything is set up correctly:\n\n### Steps to Export Postcards Email Templates to SendGrid\n\n1. **Create Your Template in Postcards:**\n   - Open the Postcards app and design your email template. Make sure to include SendGrid tags if needed.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Export Option:**\n   - Once your template is ready, go to the top right corner of the Postcards app and click on the export option.\n   - Select 'Integrations' from the dropdown menu.\n\n3. **Choose SendGrid Integration:**\n   - In the pop-up window, select 'SendGrid' from the list of integration options.\n\n4. **Connect to SendGrid:**\n   - You will be prompted to enter your SendGrid API key. If you don’t have one, you can generate it in your SendGrid account under 'Settings' > 'API Keys'.\n   - Enter the API key in the Postcards app to establish the connection.\n\n5. **Export and Preview:**\n   - Once connected, your template will be exported to your SendGrid account.\n   - A hyperlink will appear, directing you to the templates section in SendGrid where you can preview your exported template.\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips\n\n- **Check API Key:** Ensure that the API key you are using has the correct permissions and is entered correctly.\n- **Internet Connection:** Make sure you have a stable internet connection during the export process.\n- **SendGrid Account:** Verify that your SendGrid account is active and not facing any restrictions.\n\nIf you continue to face issues, you might want to check out the detailed tutorial [here](https://help.designmodo.com/article/postcards-sendgrid/) or escalate the issue to our support team by clicking `Contact Support` from the chat header menu.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you need further assistance!",

It allows users to import and publish static websites on WordPress. This is particularly useful for users who have created websites using Designmodo's [Slides](https://designmodo.com/slides/) or [Startup](https://designmodo.com/startup/) tools.\n\n### Key Capabilities and Functions\n\n1. **Importing Static Websites**:\n   - The plugin enables you to upload a static website (usually in a .zip file) directly to your WordPress site. This is ideal for users who have designed their site using tools like Slides or Startup and want to host it on WordPress.\n\n2. **Publishing Static Pages**:\n   - Once uploaded, the plugin allows you to publish these static pages on your WordPress site. This means you can have multiple static pages, each with its own URL, hosted on your WordPress site.\n\n3. **Setting Custom URLs**:\n   - You can set custom URLs for each static page. For example, you can set a page to be your homepage or assign it a specific path like `/campaign`.\n\n4. **Creating Landing Pages and A/B Testing**:\n   - The plugin is particularly useful for creating landing pages or conducting A/B tests. Since the pages are static, they load quickly and can be easily managed.\n\n5. **Compatibility with GitHub Pages**:\n   - If you prefer hosting your static site on GitHub Pages, there are guides available to help you with that process as well.\n\n### How to Use the Static Pages Plugin\n\n1. **Download and Install**:\n   - Download the plugin from [Designmodo](https://designmodo.com/static-pages/). It comes in a .zip file which you should not unzip.\n   - Upload the .zip file to your WordPress site via the Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin menu.\n   - Install and activate the plugin.\n\n2. **Upload Your Static Website**:\n   - Navigate to the Static Pages menu in your WordPress dashboard.\n   - Click the Upload archive button and select the .zip file containing your static website.\n   - Ensure that the files are not placed in a folder when archived. If they are, re-archive them correctly by selecting all files and folders in the root directory and compressing them.\n\n3. **Set the Page’s URL**:\n   - After uploading, you can set the URL for the static page. Use `/` for the homepage or specify a different string for other pages.\n   - Save the changes and use the Open in New Tab link to view your static page.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- [How to Upload Your Startup Website to GitHub Pages](https://help.designmodo.com/article/startup-github-pages/)\n- [How to Add a Sticky Navigation Bar to Your Startup Template](https://help.designmodo.com/article/startup-sticky-navigation-bar/)\n- [How to Add a Page Scroll Progress Bar at the Top of Your Startup Webpage](https://help.designmodo.com/article/startup-page-scroll-progress-bar/)\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [Designmodo Help Center](https://help.designmodo.com/article/startup-static-wordpress/).\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",

                    "message": "Oh no! Let's get that sorted out. Here are a few steps you can take to ensure your email template looks great in Outlook:\n\n### 1. **Use Postcards for Outlook Templates**\nDesignmodo's Postcards tool is specifically designed to create email templates that work seamlessly with Outlook. You can use the drag-and-drop editor to customize your template and ensure it looks perfect.\n\n- **Try it out here:** [Postcards App](https://designmodo.com/postcards/app/)\n\n### 2. **Test with Litmus and Email on Acid**\nDesignmodo employs the services of Litmus and Email on Acid to rigorously test email templates. These tools can help you identify and fix rendering issues in Outlook.\n\n### 3. **Check for Compatibility Issues**\nOutlook can be tricky with certain HTML and CSS properties. Make sure to:\n- Avoid using CSS properties that Outlook doesn't support well, like `float` and `position`.\n- Use inline CSS instead of embedded or external styles.\n- Stick to tables for layout, as Outlook handles table-based designs better.\n\n### 4. **Use Pre-Tested Templates**\nDesignmodo offers a wide range of pre-tested templates that are known to work well with Outlook. You can find templates for various categories and customize them to fit your needs.\n\n- **Explore Templates:** [All Templates](https://designmodo.com/email-templates/)\n\n### 5. **Export Correctly**\nWhen exporting your template from Postcards, ensure you are using the correct export settings for Outlook. Postcards allows you to export the template directly to Outlook or as a plain HTML file.\n\n### 6. **Dark Mode Compatibility**\nEnsure your template is compatible with dark mode, as many users prefer this setting. Designmodo's templates are designed to adapt to dark mode, reducing eye strain and improving engagement.\n\n### 7. **Resources and Guides**\nCheck out these resources for more detailed guidance on creating and optimizing email templates for Outlook:\n- [Ultimate Guide to Email Design with Examples](https://designmodo.com/email-design/)\n- [How to Drive Transactional Email Engagement for E-Commerce](https://designmodo.com/transactional-email-engagement/)\n- [Win-Back Email Newsletters: Engaging Examples for Marketing](https://designmodo.com/win-back-email-newsletters/)\n- [Email Signature Design Guide](https://designmodo.com/email-signature/)\n\n### Need More Help?\nIf you continue to experience issues, you can escalate your query to human support by clicking `Contact Support` from the chat header menu.\n\nFeel free to try these steps and let me know if you need further assistance!",

If the image is stored locally, the path should be relative to your HTML file. If it's hosted online, make sure the URL is correct.\n\n2. **Verify the Image File:**\n   - Make sure the image file is in the correct directory and hasn't been moved or deleted.\n\n3. **Update the Image Source in HTML:**\n   - Open your HTML file in a text editor and locate the `<img>` tag for the missing image.\n   - Ensure the `src` attribute points to the correct path or URL of the image.\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"path/to/your/image.jpg\" alt=\"Description of image\">\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Typos:**\n   - Double-check for any typos in the file name or path.\n\n5. **Inspect the Browser Console:**\n   - Open your webpage in a browser and use the developer tools (usually accessible by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).\n   - Check the console for any errors related to the image loading.\n\n6. **Ensure Correct File Permissions:**\n   - If the image is hosted online, make sure the file permissions allow it to be viewed publicly.\n\n### Example of Correct Image Path\n\nIf your image is stored in a folder named `images` within the same directory as your HTML file, your `<img>` tag should look like this:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"images/your-image.jpg\" alt=\"Description of image\">\n```\n\n### Additional Resources\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the following articles from Designmodo's Knowledge Base:\n- [How to Customize the Images on Your Exported Startup Template](https://help.designmodo.com/article/startup-custom-images/)\n- [How to Add and Customize Background Images on Your Slides](https://designmodo.helpscoutdocs.com/article/132-add-customize-background-images-slides)\n\nIf you still need help, feel free to [Contact Us](https://designmodo.helpscoutdocs.com/article/110-upload-email-mailwizz) for further assistance.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you get your image back in no time!",

If it doesn't, the issue is with the URL or the image location.\n\n3. **Check the Image Hosting:**\n   - If the image is hosted online, ensure the hosting service is up and running.\n   - Verify that the image is publicly accessible and not restricted by permissions.\n\n4. **Use a Different Hosting Service:**\n   - If the current hosting service is unreliable, consider uploading the image to a different service like Imgur, Dropbox, or your own web server.\n\n5. **Update the Image URL in Your HTML:**\n   - Once you have a working URL, update the `src` attribute in your HTML file.\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"https://new-hosting-service.com/path/to/your/image.jpg\" alt=\"Description of image\">\n   ```\n\n### Example of Correct Image URL\n\nIf you are using an online hosting service, your `<img>` tag should look like this:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://example.com/images/your-image.jpg\" alt=\"Description of image\">\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Relative vs. Absolute URLs:**\n  - If the image is hosted on the same server as your website, use a relative URL.\n  - If the image is hosted on a different server, use an absolute URL.\n\n- **Check for Redirects:**\n  - Sometimes URLs can redirect to a different location. Ensure the final URL is correct.\n\n### Example of Using a Different Hosting Service\n\nIf you decide to use a service like Imgur, upload your image and get the direct link. Then update your HTML:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/your-image.jpg\" alt=\"Description of image\">\n```\n\n### Resources for Image Hosting\n\n- [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)\n- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)\n- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, please provide the URL you are using (if possible), and I can help you troubleshoot further.",

                    "message": "It sounds like you're experiencing some common issues with HTML email rendering in Outlook. Outlook uses the Microsoft Word engine to render HTML emails, which can cause some discrepancies compared to other email clients. Here are a few steps you can take to address these issues:\n\n### Background Image\nOutlook does not support background images in the same way that web browsers do. To ensure your background images display correctly, you can use VML (Vector Markup Language) to add background images specifically for Outlook.\n\nHere's an example of how to add a background image using VML:\n\n```html\n<!--[if gte mso 9]>\n<v:rect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" fill=\"true\" stroke=\"false\" style=\"width:600px;height:400px;\">\n  <v:fill type=\"frame\" src=\"your-image-url.jpg\" color=\"#ffffff\" />\n  <v:textbox inset=\"0,0,0,0\">\n<![endif]-->\n<div>\n  <!-- Your email content here -->\n</div>\n<!--[if gte mso 9]>\n  </v:textbox>\n</v:rect>\n<![endif]-->\n```\n\n### Rounded Buttons\nOutlook does not support the `border-radius` property for rounding corners on buttons. Instead, you can use VML to create rounded buttons that will display correctly in Outlook.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a rounded button using VML:\n\n```html\n<!--[if mso]>\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://example.com\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" stroke=\"f\" fillcolor=\"#ff0000\">\n  <w:anchorlock/>\n  <center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;\">\n    Click Here\n  </center>\n</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]-->\n<![if !mso]>\n<a href=\"https://example.com\" style=\"display:inline-block;background-color:#ff0000;color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;line-height:40px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:200px;-webkit-border-radius:4px;-moz-border-radius:4px;border-radius:4px;\">\n  Click Here\n</a>\n<![endif]>\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n1. **Test Your Email**: Use tools like Litmus or Email on Acid to test your email across different email clients, including various versions of Outlook.\n2. **Fallbacks**: Always provide fallback colors and styles for email clients that do not support advanced CSS properties.\n3. **Inline CSS**: Ensure all your CSS is inlined, as many email clients strip out `<style>` tags.\n\n### Resources\n- [Designmodo Postcards](https://designmodo.com/postcards/): Use Postcards to create and customize your email templates easily.\n- [Designmodo Knowledge Base](https://designmodo.helpscoutdocs.com/): Find more detailed guides and tutorials.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, feel free to reach out to our support team by clicking `Contact Support` from the chat header menu.",

Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Open Your Template**: Open your Postcards email template in a text editor.\n\n2. **Locate the Grid Items**: Find the HTML elements that represent your grid items. These are typically `<div>` elements or other block-level elements.\n\n3. **Add CSS for 50% Width**: Add a CSS rule to set the width of these elements to 50%. You can do this by adding a style block in the head of your HTML or by adding inline styles.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do it:\n\n### Using Inline Styles\n```html\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left;\">\n  <!-- Your grid item content here -->\n</div>\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left;\">\n  <!-- Your grid item content here -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Using a CSS Class\nFirst, add a style block in the head of your HTML:\n```html\n<style>\n  .grid-item {\n    width: 50%;\n    float: left;\n  }\n</style>\n```\n\nThen, apply the class to your grid items:\n```html\n<div class=\"grid-item\">\n  <!-- Your grid item content here -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"grid-item\">\n  <!-- Your grid item content here -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Using Flexbox\nIf you prefer using Flexbox, you can do it like this:\n```html\n<style>\n  .grid-container {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n  }\n  .grid-item {\n    flex: 0 0 50%;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"grid-container\">\n  <div class=\"grid-item\">\n    <!-- Your grid item content here -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-item\">\n    <!-- Your grid item content here -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Using Bootstrap Classes\nIf you are using Bootstrap, you can use the grid system classes:\n```html\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-6\">\n    <!-- Your grid item content here -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-6\">\n    <!-- Your grid item content here -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your grid items take up 50% of the container's width, creating a two-column layout.",

Gmail, in particular, has limited support for custom fonts and often defaults to web-safe fonts if the specified font isn't available.\n\nTo ensure your email displays the desired font, you can use a web-safe font or embed a Google Font. Unfortunately, the Impact font is not a web-safe font and is not supported by Gmail. Here’s a workaround using Google Fonts:\n\n### Steps to Use Google Fonts in Your Postcards Email Template\n\n1. **Choose a Google Font**:\n   - Go to the [Google Fonts website](https://fonts.google.com/).\n   - Select a font that you like. For example, you can choose a font like \"Roboto\" or \"Noto Serif\".\n\n2. **Embed the Font in Your HTML**:\n   - Click on the font you want to use.\n   - Click the \"Select this style\" button.\n   - Go to the \"Embed\" tab and copy the `<link>` tag provided.\n\n3. **Add the Font to Your Postcards Template**:\n   - Open your exported Postcards template in a text editor like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code.\n   - Paste the `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file.\n\n   ```html\n   <head>\n       <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n   </head>\n   ```\n\n4. **Update the Font in Your CSS**:\n   - Replace instances of \"Impact\" with the new Google Font in your CSS.\n\n   ```css\n   body {\n       font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Save and Test**:\n   - Save your changes and open the HTML file in your browser to ensure the font is applied correctly.\n   - Send a test email to your Gmail account to verify that the font displays as expected.\n\n### Additional Resources\n- [How to Change the Font in an Exported Email Template](https://designmodo.helpscoutdocs.com/article/85-change-font-exported-email-template)\n- [How to Send a Postcards Email Template with Gmail](https://designmodo.helpscoutdocs.com/article/116-upload-email-gmail)\n\nIf you need further assistance, feel free to [contact support](https://designmodo.helpscoutdocs.com/article/85-change-font-exported-email-template).",

You can do this by selecting the button and checking its alignment settings.\n\n2. **Inspect the Exported Code:**\n   After exporting, inspect the HTML and CSS of the exported file. Look for the button's CSS properties to ensure it has the correct alignment.\n\n3. **Add Custom CSS:**\n   If the alignment is still off, you can add custom CSS to enforce the center alignment. Here’s an example of how you can do it:\n\n   ```css\n   .button-class {\n       display: block;\n       margin-left: auto;\n       margin-right: auto;\n       text-align: center;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Replace `.button-class` with the actual class or ID of your button.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicting Styles:**\n   Sometimes, other CSS rules might override your button's alignment. Use browser developer tools (right-click on the button and select \"Inspect\") to see if there are any conflicting styles.\n\n5. **Export Settings:**\n   Ensure that you have selected the correct export settings in Postcards. Sometimes, not selecting the \"Host images online\" option can cause issues with the layout.\n\nIf you need more detailed guidance, you can refer to the [Designmodo Knowledge Base](https://designmodo.helpscoutdocs.com/) or specific articles like [Exporting Postcards Email Template to Mailchimp](https://designmodo.helpscoutdocs.com/article/203-postcards-mailchimp).\n\nIf the issue persists, feel free to reach out to our support team by clicking `Contact Support` from the chat header menu.",

Let's tackle this step-by-step to ensure your email looks just as perfect as it does in the design view.\n\n### Steps to Fix Font and Size Issues in SendGrid\n\n1. **Check the Font Embedding:**\n   Ensure that the font you are using is properly embedded in your HTML. If you're using a custom font, make sure you have included the correct link to the font in the `<head>` section of your HTML.\n\n   ```html\n   <head>\n     <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=YourFontName:wght@400;700&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n   </head>\n   ```\n\n2. **Specify Fallback Fonts:**\n   Always specify fallback fonts in your CSS to ensure that if the custom font fails to load, a similar font is used. This can help maintain the look and feel of your email.\n\n   ```css\n   body {\n     font-family: 'YourFontName', Arial, sans-serif;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Inline CSS for Email Clients:**\n   Some email clients strip out `<style>` tags, so it's a good practice to use inline CSS for critical styles like font size and family.\n\n   ```html\n   <p style=\"font-family: 'YourFontName', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\n     Your text here\n   </p>\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Media Queries:**\n   Ensure that there are no media queries or CSS rules that might be changing the font size for different screen sizes or email clients.\n\n5. **Test in Different Email Clients:**\n   Use tools like Litmus or Email on Acid to test your email in different email clients. This can help you identify specific clients that might be causing issues.\n\n6. **SendGrid Specific Settings:**\n   Sometimes, SendGrid's design view might not reflect the actual rendering in email clients. Make sure to check the HTML and CSS in the \"Code Editor\" view in SendGrid to ensure everything is correct.\n\n### Example of Correct HTML Structure\n\nHere's an example of how your HTML should look:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Serif:wght@400;700&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n  <style>\n    body {\n      font-family: 'Noto Serif', Arial, sans-serif;\n      font-size: 16px;\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <p style=\"font-family: 'Noto Serif', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\n    Your text here\n  </p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Additional Resources\n\nFor more detailed steps on changing fonts in your Postcards email template, you can refer to this [guide](https://help.designmodo.com/article/postcards-change-font-email/).\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, feel free to reach out for further assistance or click `Contact Support` from the chat header menu to escalate your query to human support.\n\nGood luck, and happy emailing! 😊",

Here are a few tips to help you troubleshoot and resolve these issues:\n\n### Background Images\nOutlook, especially older versions, does not support background images in the same way that web browsers do. To ensure your background images display correctly, you can use VML (Vector Markup Language), which is supported by Outlook.\n\nHere's an example of how to add a background image using VML:\n\n```html\n<!--[if gte mso 9]>\n<v:rect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" fill=\"true\" stroke=\"false\" style=\"width:600px;height:400px;\">\n  <v:fill type=\"frame\" src=\"background-image-url.jpg\" color=\"#ffffff\" />\n  <v:textbox inset=\"0,0,0,0\">\n<![endif]-->\n<div>\n  <!-- Your email content here -->\n</div>\n<!--[if gte mso 9]>\n  </v:textbox>\n</v:rect>\n<![endif]-->\n```\n\n### Rounded Buttons\nOutlook does not support border-radius for buttons. To create rounded buttons, you can use VML as well. Here’s an example:\n\n```html\n<!--[if mso]>\n<v:roundrect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" xmlns:w=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word\" href=\"https://example.com\" style=\"height:40px;v-text-anchor:middle;width:200px;\" arcsize=\"10%\" stroke=\"f\" fillcolor=\"#ff0000\">\n  <w:anchorlock/>\n  <center style=\"color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;\">\n    Button Text\n  </center>\n</v:roundrect>\n<![endif]-->\n<![if !mso]>\n<a href=\"https://example.com\" style=\"display:inline-block;background-color:#ff0000;color:#ffffff;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;border-radius:4px;padding:10px 20px;\">\n  Button Text\n</a>\n<![endif]>\n```\n\n### General Tips\n1. **Test in Multiple Clients**: Use tools like Litmus or Email on Acid to test your email in various clients, including different versions of Outlook.\n2. **Fallbacks**: Always provide fallback colors or images for clients that do not support certain features.\n3. **Inline CSS**: Use inline CSS for styling as much as possible, as some email clients strip out `<style>` tags.\n\n### Resources\n- [Designmodo Postcards](https://designmodo.com/postcards/): Use Postcards to create and customize your email templates easily.\n- [Designmodo Help Articles](https://help.designmodo.com/): Find more detailed guides and troubleshooting tips.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, you might want to reach out to Designmodo support for more personalized assistance.

Postcards offers a variety of modules that are designed to incorporate social media links easily.\n\n2. **Customize the Module**: Once you've selected the appropriate module, you can customize it according to your needs. This includes adjusting the layout, colors, and of course, adding your specific social media links.\n\n3. **Insert Social Media Links**: In the module's settings, you'll find options to insert URLs for your social media profiles. Simply paste the links to your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, or other social media pages in the designated fields.\n\n4. **Preview and Test**: After adding your social media links, make sure to preview the module to ensure that the icons are correctly linked and displayed. It's also a good idea to test the links to confirm they lead to the correct pages.\n\n5. **Export Your Project**: Once you're satisfied with the appearance and functionality of your social media links, you can export your project.
