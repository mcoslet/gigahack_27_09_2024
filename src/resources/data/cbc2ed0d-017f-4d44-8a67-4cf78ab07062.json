However, Indian Railways' broad gauge tracks have rails placed 1676 mm apart.\n   - When the same scaling logic is applied to Indian Railways' broad gauge, the calculated scale comes out to be approximately 1:100.\n\n2. **Proportion Accuracy:**\n   - Using the 1:87 scale for Indian Railways models resulted in distorted proportions, making the models look \"weird\" and not true to the original.\n   - The Pink Engine aims for perfection and authenticity in their models, which led them to adopt the 1:100 scale to ensure accurate proportions.\n\n3. **Compatibility with HO Tracks:**\n   - Despite the different scale, the models are designed to stand on standard HO tracks (16.5 mm gauge), making use of widely available tracks and accessories.\n\n### Summary\nThe 1:100 scale ensures that the models accurately represent the proportions of Indian Railways' broad gauge trains while remaining compatible with HO gauge tracks. This choice reflects The Pink Engine’s commitment to producing high-quality, realistic models for enthusiasts who grew up with or admire Indian Railways.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",

Here's a breakdown to help you understand these differences:\n\n### Build Kits vs. Premium Readymade Models\n\n1. **Build Kits**\n   - **Price:** Typically around ₹2,499.00 to ₹2,699.00.\n   - **Assembly Required:** These kits require the buyer to assemble the model themselves. This can be a fun and engaging activity for hobbyists.\n   - **Materials and Finish:** The pieces are usually 3D printed and may have slight imperfections. They do not require painting, but the finish may not be as polished as the premium models.\n   - **Wheels and Bogies:** Non-rotating plastic wheels, which might be less functional compared to those in premium models.\n   - **Weight and Dimensions:** Generally lighter and may have simpler construction.\n\n2. **Premium Readymade Models**\n   - **Price:** Typically around ₹9,999.00 to ₹16,999.00.\n   - **Fully Assembled:** These models come fully assembled and ready to use right out of the box.\n   - **High-Quality Materials and Finish:** These models are photo-finished, ensuring a high level of detail and quality. They often have rotating bogies for better navigation on tracks.\n   - **Functional Features:** May include functional couplers and other operational features that enhance the realism and usability of the model.\n   - **Weight and Dimensions:** Heavier and sturdier construction, reflecting the premium materials and detailed craftsmanship.\n\n### Factors Contributing to Price Differences\n\n- **Level of Detail:** Premium models have a higher level of detail, more accurate paint jobs, and intricate features that require more time and effort to produce.\n- **Materials Used:** Higher-quality materials are used in premium models, contributing to their durability and realistic appearance.\n- **Labor and Craftsmanship:** The time and skill required to assemble and finish premium models justify the higher price. These models are often handcrafted or meticulously assembled to meet high standards.\n- **Functionality:** Premium models usually have operational features such as rotating bogies and functional couplers, which enhance the model's performance and realism.\n\n### Example Comparison\n\n- **WDP4 Build Kit - 1:100 HO Gauge IR Scale**\n  - **Price:** ₹2,499.00\n  - **Features:** Easy to assemble, non-rotating plastic wheels, some imperfections due to 3D printing.\n\n- **WDP4 - Premium Readymade 1:100 HO Gauge**\n  - **Price:** ₹9,999.00\n  - **Features:** Fully assembled, photo-finished, rotating bogies, functional couplers, higher weight for better stability.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe price differences reflect the varying levels of detail, quality, and functionality between build kits and premium readymade models. Build kits are budget-friendly and cater to hobbyists who enjoy the assembly process, while premium models are designed for collectors and enthusiasts seeking high-quality, ready-to-use models.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any more questions or need further clarification!",

                    "message": "The 1:100 scale, also known as the **IR Scale**, was specially designed for Indian Railways models. Here’s why we chose this scale:\n\n### Why 1:100 Scale?\n\n- **Proportional Accuracy**:\n  - The standard HO Scale (1:87) is widely used but it was designed for standard gauge tracks (1435 mm).\n  - Indian Railways uses a broader gauge (1676 mm). Using the 1:87 scale makes the models look disproportionate.\n  - By recalculating, we found that a 1:100 scale better represents the dimensions of Indian Railways on HO tracks.\n\n- **Compatibility**:\n  - The 1:100 scale models are designed to run on standard HO tracks, making them accessible and easy to integrate with existing layouts.\n\n- **Attention to Detail**:\n  - Our models keep the intricate details and proportions accurate to real Indian Railways trains, maintaining the essence and look of the actual locomotives and coaches.\n\n### More Insights:\n- **Read More**: You can delve deeper into why we adopted this scale and the entire thought process behind it in our blog post. Here's the link: [The IR Scale](https://www.thepinkengine.com/post/the-ir-scale)\n\n![IR Scale](https://www.thepinkengine.com/post/the-ir-scale)\n\nThis customization ensures that our models look authentic and true to the real-life Indian Railways experience.
