Not all assistants require top-tier precision, and in many cases, more cost-effective models will deliver satisfactory results, helping you manage costs effectively.\n\n3. **Customization**: Different roles and use cases may benefit from different models. For example, a Sales Assistant might need a model with high persuasiveness, while a Knowledge Base Support assistant might prioritize accuracy and detail.\n\n4. **Flexibility**: Having multiple LLM options allows you to tailor the assistant's capabilities to your specific needs, ensuring that it performs optimally for the tasks it is designed to handle.\n\nBy choosing the right LLM, you can balance performance, cost, and the specific requirements of your assistant's role.",

Here’s how you can do it:\n\n### Learning Context Settings\n\n1. **Overview**:\n   - The \"Learning Context\" tab is where you define the resources that your AI assistant will use to gather information and context for answering questions. Without adding learning resources, the assistant will not function effectively.\n\n2. **Resource Types**:\n   - **Website Links**:\n     - **Description**: You can add multiple specific URLs that the assistant will read and learn from. This can include any webpages that are relevant to the assistant’s purpose.\n     - **Reading Method**:\n       - **URLs Only**: The assistant will only read the exact URLs you provide. For example, if you enter `https://fineguide.ai/pricing`, the assistant will only learn from the content on that specific page. This method is precise and ensures that the assistant only gathers information from the specified pages.\n       - **URLs and Subpaths**: The assistant will read the URLs and explore their subpaths as well. For example, if you enter `https://fineguide.ai/`, the assistant will read not only the main page but also all the linked subpages like `https://fineguide.ai/pricing`, `https://fineguide.ai/contacts`, and any other pages under the `fineguide.ai` domain. This method allows the assistant to gather a broader context but can consume more context-characters, making it more resource-intensive.\n     - **Sync Frequency**:\n       - Options include \"Once,\" \"Daily,\" or \"Weekly\" to determine how often the assistant should resync with the provided URLs to update its learning context.\n   - **Files**:\n     - **Description**: You can upload multiple files for the assistant to learn from. This can include documents such as PDFs, spreadsheets, or text files.\n     - **File Upload**: You can drag and drop files or use the \"Upload File\" button to select files from your device.\n\n3. **Resource List**:\n   - Once resources are added, they will appear in the list under \"Website Links\" or \"Files,\" showing details such as the resource name, status, character usage, and when it was created or last synced.\n\nThese settings allow you to provide your AI assistant with the necessary context and information to accurately and effectively respond to user queries based on the specific resources you define.",

Make sure you are editing the active theme (the one currently in use on your site).\n\n4. **Edit the Footer File**:\n   - In the list of theme files, find and click on the `footer.php` file. This file is typically where you will add the JavaScript code to ensure it loads on every page.\n\n5. **Paste the JavaScript Code**:\n   - Scroll to the bottom of the `footer.php` file. Just before the closing `</body>` tag, paste the JavaScript code snippet you obtained from Fineguide.\n\n   Example:\n   ```html\n   <!-- Other footer content -->\n\n   <!-- Paste your JavaScript code here -->\n   <script>\n     // Example JavaScript code snippet\n     (function() {\n       var script = document.createElement('script');\n       script.src = 'https://your-assistant-url.com/assistant.js';\n       script.async = true;\n       document.body.appendChild(script);\n     })();\n   </script>\n\n   </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n6. **Save Changes**:\n   - After pasting the code, click the `Update File` button to save your changes.\n\n### Alternative Method: Using a Plugin\n\nIf you prefer not to edit theme files directly, you can use a plugin to add custom JavaScript to your site.

Here's a detailed explanation of how the consumption model works:\n\n### Consumption Model Overview\n\n1. **Credit-Based System:**\n   - Fineguide uses a credit-based system where each interaction with an AI model consumes a specific number of credits.\n   - The number of credits consumed depends on the complexity and processing power required by the model.\n\n2. **Credit Allocation:**\n   - When you subscribe to a Fineguide plan, you are allocated a certain number of credits based on your subscription tier.\n   - These credits can be used across different models and services offered by Fineguide.\n\n3. **Credit Consumption:**\n   - Each request to an AI model consumes a certain number of credits. More advanced models typically consume more credits per request.\n   - For example, a request to GPT-3.5 Turbo might consume fewer credits compared to a request to GPT-4o.\n\n### Subscription Tiers and Credit Allocation\n\n1. **Basic Plan:**\n   - **Credits:** A limited number of credits suitable for small-scale usage or testing.\n   - **Models:** Access to basic models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3.0 Haiku.\n\n2. **Standard Plan:**\n   - **Credits:** A higher number of credits suitable for medium-scale usage.\n   - **Models:** Access to a broader range of models, including more advanced options.\n\n3. **Premium Plan:**\n   - **Credits:** The highest number of credits, ideal for large-scale usage.\n   - **Models:** Access to all available models, including the most advanced ones.\n\n### Managing Credit Usage\n\n1. **Real-Time Monitoring:**\n   - Fineguide provides tools to track and monitor your credit usage in real-time. This helps you stay within your allocated credits and manage your usage efficiently.\n   - You can set up alerts to notify you when you are approaching your credit limit.\n\n2. **Refilling Credits:**\n   - If you run out of credits before the end of your billing cycle, you have the option to purchase additional credits.\n   - This ensures that you can continue using the services without interruption.\n\n3. **Optimizing Usage:**\n   - You can optimize your credit usage by choosing the most efficient model for each task. For example, using a simpler model for basic tasks and reserving more advanced models for complex tasks.\n   - This helps manage costs and ensures that you get the best value from your subscription.\n\n### Example of Credit Consumption\n\n- **GPT-3.5 Turbo:**\n  - **Simple Query:** 1 credit per request.\n  - **Complex Query:** 2 credits per request.\n\n- **GPT-4o:**\n  - **Simple Query:** 3 credits per request.\n  - **Complex Query:** 5 credits per request.\n\n- **Claude 3.0 Haiku:**\n  - **Simple Query:** 1 credit per request.\n  - **Complex Query:** 2 credits per request.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe consumption model in Fineguide is designed to provide flexibility and scalability, allowing you to manage your usage of various AI models efficiently. By understanding how credits are allocated and consumed, you can optimize your usage to get the best value from your subscription.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further details about the consumption model, feel free to ask!",

Customize colors - we don't have font customization, we only have three templates to choose form - minimalist (a minimalist style template), traditional (a more modern template but with little UX features), default (a modern chat template with a modern look and feel).  Next - the user can customize the colors for the desired template. We allow only the colors to be modified. We don't support CSS and other parameters to be configured. 3. Upload your logo - there are two images a user can upload - first is the assistant avatar which gives the assistant a humanized look. The assistant avatar can be changed by going to \"Assistant Persona\" tab. The second image is the chat widget \"messenger\" icon. By default we use the same image as the Assistant's avatar, but this can be changed to a different image, to change it - go to Appearance tab, change the image where it says \"The chat icon when chat is collapsed\".",

For example, if your assistant needs to provide legal advice or medical information, a more advanced model will ensure the information is accurate and reliable.\n\n2. **Flexibility with Plans and Needs:**\n   - Depending on your subscription plan, you can choose models that fit your budget and needs.\n   - For simple tasks, you can use an assistant with a cheaper model. For example, if your assistant is used for basic customer service queries like order status or store hours, a less expensive model will suffice.\n   - For more detailed tasks, you can use an assistant with a more advanced model. For instance, if your assistant needs to handle complex technical support or provide in-depth product recommendations, a more advanced model will be more effective.\n\n3. **Handling Different Topics:**\n   - Different models are good at different things. Using multiple models helps your assistant handle a wide range of topics.\n   - This means your assistant can answer more types of questions accurately. For example, one model might be better at understanding and generating conversational responses, while another might excel at processing technical documents or scientific data.\n   - By combining these strengths, your assistant can provide high-quality responses across various domains, from casual conversations to specialized knowledge areas.\n\n4. **Efficient Use of Credits:**\n   - Using multiple models helps you manage your credits better.\n   - You can assign simpler tasks to an assistant with a cheaper model and more complex tasks to an assistant with a more expensive model.\n   - This way, you optimize the use of your credits by not overusing expensive models for tasks that don't require them. For example, you might have one assistant for general inquiries using a basic model and another for detailed analytics or consulting using a premium model.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Using more LLM models makes your AI assistant more accurate, flexible, and efficient.\n- This helps your assistant serve your users better by providing the right level of detail and accuracy for different types of queries.\n\nIf you need any help or have more questions, our support team is here for you!\n```\n\nPlease review this updated draft and let me know if any further adjustments are needed!",

Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open your website's HTML file**: This could be an index.html file or any other file where you want the chatbot to appear.\n2. **Paste the code**: Insert the integration code just before the closing `</body>` tag. This ensures that the chatbot loads after the rest of your content.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Your Website</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Your website content -->\n\n    <!-- Chatbot Integration Code -->\n    <script src=\"https://path-to-your-chatbot-integration-code.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Customize the Chatbot\nDepending on the chatbot service you are using, you might have options to customize the appearance and behavior of the chatbot. This could include:\n\n- **Changing the color scheme** to match your website’s branding.\n- **Setting up welcome messages** to greet users.\n- **Configuring the chatbot’s responses** to common queries.\n\n### Step 4: Test the Integration\nAfter embedding the code and customizing the chatbot, it’s important to test the integration:\n\n1. **Open your website in a browser**.\n2. **Interact with the chatbot** to ensure it’s working as expected.\n3. **Check for any errors** in the browser’s console and fix them if necessary.\n\n### Step 5: Go Live\nOnce you’ve tested the chatbot and ensured everything is working correctly, you can go live with the integration. Monitor the chatbot’s performance and user interactions to make any necessary adjustments.\n\n### Additional Resources\nIf you need more detailed instructions or run into any issues, you can refer to the documentation provided by the chatbot service or contact their support team for assistance.\n\nWould you like to schedule a call with our support team to help you with the integration?

Here are some key points to help you make an informed decision:\n\n### 1. **Understand Your Requirements**\n- **Accuracy vs. Cost**: More advanced models like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet offer higher accuracy but consume more credits. If your use case requires detailed and precise responses, investing in a more advanced model might be worthwhile. For simpler tasks, a less expensive model like GPT-3.5 turbo could suffice.\n- **Role-Specific Needs**: Different roles (Customer Support, Sales Assistant, Tech Support, etc.) may benefit from different models. For example, a Sales Assistant might need a model with higher persuasiveness and follow-up capabilities.\n\n### 2. **Evaluate the Models**\n- **Credit Consumption**: Each model uses a different amount of credits per request. Advanced models consume more credits, so balance your need for accuracy with your budget.\n- **Performance**: Test a few models to see which one best suits your needs. Fineguide allows you to switch between models, so you can find the optimal balance between cost and performance.\n\n### 3. **Customization and Flexibility**\n- **Personality Settings**: Customize the assistant’s manner of speaking, persuasiveness, verbosity, and follow-up questions to align with your brand’s voice and values.\n- **Learning Resources**: Add specific URLs or documents to enhance the assistant’s knowledge base. Choose between 'URLs Only' for specific pages or 'URLs and Subpaths' for broader context.\n\n### 4. **Integration and Scalability**\n- **Third-Party Integrations**: Ensure the chosen model can integrate seamlessly with your existing tools and platforms.\n- **Scalability**: Consider the assistant’s ability to handle increasing volumes of queries as your business grows.\n\n### 5. **Cost Management**\n- **Subscription Plans**: Fineguide offers various plans with different credit limits and features. Choose a plan that aligns with your expected usage and budget.\n- **Efficient Use of Credits**: Assign simpler tasks to a cheaper model and reserve advanced models for complex queries to optimize credit usage.\n\n### Example Models and Their Uses:\n- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: Suitable for general inquiries and basic customer support.\n- **GPT-4o**: Ideal for detailed and nuanced responses, such as legal or medical advice.\n- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Excellent for roles requiring high accuracy and advanced capabilities.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can select an LLM that best meets your specific needs and budget constraints.

Avoid using this option for very large websites with thousands of pages, as the assistant can only process a limited number of context pages.\n\n### Summary\n- **Choose 'URLs Only'** if you need focused information from specific pages.\n- **Choose 'URLs and Subpaths'** if you need a broader context and comprehensive understanding of a website, but be mindful of the resource limits.\n\nIf you have further questions or need assistance, feel free to open a ticket from the chat header or email support at `support@fineguide.ai`.",

This name will be displayed to users and is essential for the assistant’s identity.\n\n2. **Company or Owner:**\n   - Specify the company or individual that the assistant is representing. This is important for the assistant’s context in interactions.\n\n3. **LLM Model:**\n   - Choose from models such as \"Gpt-4o,\" \"Gpt-3.5 turbo,\" \"Claude 3.5 Sonnet,\" and others. Select the LLM that aligns with your assistant’s specific needs. Each model has a different credit consumption per message.\n\n4. **Role:**\n   - Select the role that aligns with what your assistant will be handling. Options include Customer Support, Sales Assistant, Tech Support, Knowledge Base Support, and Generic (No Predefined Prompts).\n\n5. **Welcome Message:**\n   - Craft a welcoming and informative message that the assistant will send at the beginning of each session. This sets the tone for the interaction and provides initial guidance to users.\n\n### Customization Options\n1. **Suggested Questions:**\n   - Enable this option to provide users with suggested questions that they can click on to start the conversation. Customize these questions based on what you think users will most frequently ask.\n\n2. **Notes:**\n   - Keep track of any specific configurations, ideas, or reminders related to your assistant here. This section is for your own reference and does not influence how the assistant behaves.\n\n### Personality Settings\n1. **Manner of Speaking:**\n   - Choose how the assistant will communicate in terms of style and formality. For example, \"Adaptive\" adjusts the communication style based on the user’s tone.\n\n2. **Persuasiveness:**\n   - Set the level of persuasiveness the assistant will use in its responses. This is especially useful for roles like Sales Assistant where influencing user decisions might be important.\n\n3. **Verbosity:**\n   - Define how much detail the assistant includes in its responses. \"Concise\" provides brief answers, while \"Expansive\" gives more in-depth information.\n\n4. **Follow-up Questions:**\n   - Toggle this option to decide whether your assistant should prompt users with follow-up questions based on their previous interactions. This can help keep the conversation flowing and ensure users get the information they need.\n\n### Danger Zone\n1. **Custom Prompts:**\n   - If you want to add custom prompts that the assistant can use during interactions, you can do so here. However, be cautious, as these can significantly alter the assistant's behavior.\n\n2. **Delete Assistant:**\n   - If you need to remove the assistant permanently, you can use the \"Delete Fineguide Helpdesk Permanently\" button. Be sure this is what you want, as it cannot be undone.\n\n### Appearance Tab\n1. **Theme Customization:**\n   - Toggle between customizing the light or dark theme for the chat interface. Adjust the color scheme for the selected template.\n\n2. **Chat Template:**\n   - Choose from three different chat templates to change the overall layout and style of the chat interface: Default, Traditional, and Minimalist.\n\n3. **Fineguide Footer:**\n   - Toggle this option to hide or display the Fineguide branding at the bottom of the chat interface.\n\n### Learning Resources Tab\n1. **Resource Types:**\n   - Add multiple specific URLs or upload files for the assistant to learn from. This can include any webpages or documents that are relevant to the assistant’s purpose.\n\n2. **Sync Frequency:**\n   - Options include \"Once,\" \"Daily,\" or \"Weekly\" to determine how often the assistant should resync with the provided URLs to update its learning context.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create and customize a new assistant in Fineguide to meet your specific needs.",

                    "message": "\n\nThank you for your question about adding the Google Map widget to your FineGuide assistant. I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\nTo add the Google Map widget to your FineGuide assistant, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Widget Integration Setup:\n   - Log into your FineGuide account.\n   - Navigate to the Widget Integration Setup interface in your assistant's configuration.\n   - Look for a section labeled \"Embed My Google Map\" where you can input the necessary details for your widget.\n\n2. Name Your Widget:\n   - In the first input field labeled \"Name your Widget\", give your widget a clear and descriptive name.\n   - The name should reflect the purpose or content of the map. For example, if you're embedding a map of your office location, you might call it \"Our Office Location Map\".\n\n3. Assign the Widget to Assistants:\n   - Click the \"Select Assistants\" button to choose which assistant(s) will have access to this Google Map widget.\n   - You can select multiple assistants if needed, making it versatile for different use cases.\n\n4. Obtain and Enter the Google Map URL:\n   - Go to your Google My Maps (https://www.google.com/mymaps).\n   - Select the map you want to embed.\n   - Click on the three vertical dots (More options) next to the map's title.\n   - From the dropdown menu, select \"Embed on my site\".\n   - A code snippet will appear. In the code, locate the part that says `src=\"...\"`. The URL within the quotation marks is the map's embed link.\n   - The embed URL should look something like this: `https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=YOURMAPID`\n   - Copy this URL and paste it into the \"Google Map URL\" field in the widget integration form.\n\n5. Integrate the Widget:\n   - Once you have filled in all the required fields (Widget Name, Assigned Assistants, and Google Map URL), click the \"Integrate\" button at the bottom of the setup page.\n   - This action will finalize the process, embedding the selected Google Map into the assigned assistant(s).\n\nHere's an example of how you might fill out the fields:\n- Widget Name: Our Office Location Map\n- Assigned Assistants: [Select the appropriate assistant(s)]\n- Google Map URL: https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1234567890 (Your actual URL will be different)\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. Embedding Permissions: Ensure that the Google Map you wish to embed is set to public. Private maps won't display correctly unless they are shared appropriately or made publicly accessible.\n2. Correct URL Format: Double-check that the URL you've pasted is from the `src` attribute of the embed code. Incorrect URLs or links directly to a map (rather than the embed version) will not work.\n\nAfter completing these steps, your Google Map widget should be successfully integrated into your FineGuide assistant. Users will be able to interact with the map directly within the assistant's interface.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about adding widgets or customizing your FineGuide assistant?",

Dashboard Access: It's likely that you can view conversation history by logging into your FineGuide account and accessing a dashboard or admin panel. This is typically where such information would be available.\n\n2. Assistant-specific History: Since FineGuide allows you to create multiple assistants, you might be able to view conversation history for each specific assistant separately.\n\n3. Analytics and Insights: FineGuide offers insights and analytics features. It's possible that conversation history is part of these analytics, allowing you to review past interactions for quality assurance and improvement purposes.\n\n4. Time Frame: Most platforms allow you to view conversation history within a specific time frame, such as the last 30 days or a custom date range.\n\n5. Search Functionality: There might be a search function to help you find specific conversations based on keywords, dates, or user information.\n\n6. Export Options: Some platforms offer the ability to export conversation history for offline analysis or record-keeping.\n\nTo get the most accurate and up-to-date information about viewing conversation history in FineGuide, I recommend:\n\n1. Exploring your FineGuide dashboard thoroughly. Look for sections labeled \"Conversations,\" \"History,\" or \"Analytics.\"\n\n2. Checking the platform's documentation or help center for specific instructions on accessing conversation history.\n\n3. Contacting FineGuide's support team directly. You can do this by:\n   - Looking for a \"Support\" or \"Help\" option in your dashboard\n   - Sending an email to support@fineguide.ai\n   - Using the chat feature on the FineGuide website to ask for assistance\n\nIf you need further assistance or have any other questions about FineGuide's features, please don't hesitate to ask.

                    "message": "Yes, your understanding is correct. According to the credit consumption table provided by FineGuide, GPT-4o uses 32 credits per request. In this context, a request is defined as one message from the user and one response from the bot. So, if you're having a conversation with the AI bot and it responds three times, that would indeed be 32 * 3 = 96 credits.\n\nHere are some additional details to provide more context:\n\n1. Credit Consumption: Different models consume different amounts of credits per request. For example:\n   - GPT-4o mini uses 1 credit per request\n   - Claude 3.0 Haiku uses 2 credits per request\n   - GPT-3.5 uses 3 credits per request\n   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet uses 20 credits per request\n   - GPT-4o uses 32 credits per request\n\n2. Definition of a Request: A request is counted as one message from the user and one response from the bot. This means each back-and-forth interaction consumes credits.\n\n3. Model Selection: The choice of model depends on the complexity of the task and the level of accuracy required. While GPT-4o is more expensive in terms of credit usage, it offers higher accuracy and can handle more complex queries.\n\n4. Credit Management: It's important to monitor your credit usage, especially when using more expensive models like GPT-4o. FineGuide provides notifications as you approach your credit limit.\n\n5. Subscription Plans: Different subscription plans offer different amounts of credits. For example:\n   - The Free plan offers 600 credits\n   - The Basic plan offers 10,000 credits\n   - The Standard plan offers 30,000 credits\n   - The Pro plan offers 169,000 credits\n\n6. Extra Credits: If you exhaust your monthly credit limit, FineGuide enters \"Extra Credit\" mode, where additional charges apply. The cost per extra credit varies by plan (e.g., $0.005 for Basic, $0.004 for Standard, $0.003 for Pro).\n\n7. Optimization: To optimize credit usage, you might consider using different models for different types of queries. For example, you could use a less expensive model like GPT-4o mini for simpler queries and reserve GPT-4o for more complex tasks.\n\nRemember, the credit consumption model is subject to change over time, so it's always a good idea to check the latest information in your FineGuide dashboard or documentation.",

Credit Consumption Rate: GPT-4o does indeed use 32 credits per request, as shown in the credit consumption table provided by FineGuide.\n\n2. Definition of a Request: A request is defined as one message from the user and one response from the bot. This means each back-and-forth interaction consumes credits.\n\n3. Averaging System: FineGuide uses an averaging system to calculate credit consumption. They average the credit consumption per model over all messages in their platform. This means that long and short answers are averaged for a medium value.\n\n4. Impact on Short Messages: Due to this averaging system, the actual credit cost for very short messages like \"Yes\" or \"Thank you\" will be lower than 32 credits in practice. The system takes into account that most messages will be short, which helps to decrease the overall credit consumption for GPT-4o.\n\n5. Cost Efficiency: As a result of this averaging system, the effective credit cost for GPT-4o will decrease considerably compared to the listed 32 credits per request, especially for typical short interactions.\n\n6. Balancing Act: This system allows FineGuide to balance the cost of using advanced models like GPT-4o with the reality that many interactions are brief and don't require the full power of the model.\n\n7. Optimization: To further optimize credit usage, you might consider using different models for different types of queries. For example, you could use a less expensive model like GPT-4o mini (1 credit per request) for simpler queries and reserve GPT-4o for more complex tasks.\n\nRemember, the credit consumption model is dynamic and subject to change over time.

                    "message": "To position the chat widget on the left side of your website, you need to modify the default integration code provided by Fineguide. Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Access the Integration Settings:**\n   - Log in to your Fineguide account.\n   - From the left menu, click on \"Assistants.\"\n   - Select the assistant you want to integrate.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Integration Section:**\n   - Go to the \"Integration\" tab or section.\n\n3. **Modify the Chat Widget Integration Code:**\n   - In the \"Chat Widget\" section, you will find a JavaScript snippet. The default code looks like this:\n     ```html\n     var FINEGUIDE_CHATBOT_ID = '<assistant-id>';\n     ```\n   - To position the chat widget on the left side, you need to add some CSS to the code. Here is an example of how you can modify the code:\n     ```html\n     <style>\n       .fineguide-chat-widget {\n         position: fixed;\n         left: 0;\n         bottom: 20px; /* Adjust this value to position the widget vertically */\n       }\n     </style>\n     <script>\n       var FINEGUIDE_CHATBOT_ID = '<assistant-id>';\n       // Your existing integration code here\n     </script>\n     ```\n\n4. **Paste the Modified Code into Your Website:**\n   - Copy the modified JavaScript and CSS code.\n   - Paste the code into the HTML of your website, just before the closing `</body>` tag.\n\n5. **Test the Integration:**\n   - After adding the code, visit your website to ensure the AI assistant is positioned on the left side and is working correctly.\n   - Test the chat window to make sure it appears as expected and responds appropriately.\n\nIf you need any further assistance or run into issues, please open a ticket from the current chat header or write an email to `support@fineguide.ai`.",

                    "message": "### Context Pages in Fineguide\n\n**Context** in Fineguide refers to the knowledge base that the AI assistant uses to provide accurate and relevant responses. This knowledge can come from various sources, including websites, blogs, PDFs, documents, and spreadsheets. Here’s a detailed explanation of how context pages work:\n\n#### Types of Context Sources\n1. **Web-Hosted Resources**: These are resources available online that can be accessed via a URL link.\n2. **Physical Documents**: These are files that you can upload directly to Fineguide, such as PDFs, Word documents, and spreadsheets.\n\n#### Adding Context Pages\nTo add context pages to your AI assistant, follow these steps:\n1. **Access the Assistant Settings**:\n   - Log in to your Fineguide account.\n   - From the left menu, click on \"Assistants.\"\n   - Select the assistant you want to update.\n   - Go to the \"Learning Resources\" tab or section.\n\n2. **Add Web Pages**:\n   - Click on the \"Add Resource\" button.\n   - Select the option to add a web page.\n   - Enter the URL of the web page you want to add.\n   - Provide a brief description or tags to help categorize the resource.\n   - Save the resource.\n\n3. **Add Documents**:\n   - Click on the \"Add Resource\" button.\n   - Select the option to upload a document.\n   - Choose the file from your computer (supported formats may include PDF, DOCX, etc.).\n   - Provide a brief description or tags to help categorize the resource.\n   - Save the resource.\n\n4. **Save and Update**:\n   - After adding the resources, save your changes.\n   - The platform will start a learning job, which might take a few minutes. Once this is done, the assistant will contain the new information.\n\n#### Reading Methods\nWhen adding web pages, you have two options for how the assistant will read the content:\n1. **URLs Only**: The assistant will only read the exact URLs you provide. This method is precise and ensures that the assistant only gathers information from the specified pages.\n2. **URLs and Subpaths**: The assistant will read the URLs and explore their subpaths as well. This method allows the assistant to gather a broader context but can consume more context pages, making it more resource-intensive.\n\n#### Sync Frequency\nYou can set how often the assistant should resync with the provided URLs to update its learning context. Options include:\n- Once\n- Daily\n- Weekly\n\n#### Important Considerations\n- Each resource added to the context consumes the limited context pages parameter. Depending on your subscription, the learning context might be larger or smaller.\n- Using the 'URLs and Subpaths' method can quickly consume the context limit if the crawler starts to go into numerous subpath pages. This might result in incomplete information being provided to the bot.\n\nBy understanding and managing your context pages, you can ensure that your Fineguide assistant has a comprehensive and accurate knowledge base to draw from, enhancing its ability to provide useful and relevant responses to user queries.",

For SumoApp Level 3, the limit is 300 pages. If you have exceeded this limit, you will need to either remove some existing resources or upgrade your subscription.\n\n2. **Access Assistant Settings**:\n   - Log in to your FineGuide account.\n   - From the left menu, click on \"Assistants.\"\n   - Select the assistant you want to update.\n   - Go to the \"Learning Resources\" tab or section.\n\n3. **Add Web Pages or Documents**:\n   - Click on the \"Add Resource\" button.\n   - For web pages, enter the URL and provide a brief description or tags.\n   - For documents, upload the file from your computer (supported formats include PDF, DOCX, etc.) and provide a brief description or tags.\n   - Save the resource.\n\n4. **Save and Update**:\n   - After adding the resources, save your changes.\n   - The platform will start a learning job, which might take a few minutes. Once this is done, the assistant will contain the new information.\n\n5. **URLs Only vs. URLs and Subpaths**:\n   - Use 'URLs Only' if you want the AI assistant to learn from a specific web page only.\n   - Use 'URLs and Subpaths' if you want the AI assistant to learn from the specified web page and all its subpages. Be mindful of the context limit as this method can quickly consume the context limit.\n\n6. **Subscription Plan Details**:\n   - **SumoApp Level 3**: \n     - Learning Context Limit: 300 Pages\n     - Assistants Limit: 3\n     - Other features include Persona Customization, Human Escalation, Chat Appearance Customizer, Widgets Support, Removable Fineguide logo, Scheduled Website Re-Crawling, 3rd party integrations, and API Access.\n\nIf you have verified that you are within your context limit and still face issues, it might be a technical problem.

These pages provide the necessary background knowledge that the assistant relies on to deliver accurate and relevant responses.\n\nHere are some key points about context pages:\n\n1. **Types of Context Pages**: Context pages can include various types of resources, such as:\n   - Web pages (URLs)\n   - Documents (PDFs, Word files, etc.)\n\n2. **Consumption of Context Pages**: Each resource added to the assistant's context consumes a portion of the limited context pages parameter.

This is useful for static content that doesn't change often.\n   - **URLs and Subpaths**: The assistant will read the specified page and all its linked subpages. This method is beneficial for dynamic content spread across multiple pages but can quickly consume the context limit.\n\n4. **Importance of Context Pages**: Having a well-defined set of context pages allows the assistant to provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n5. **Limitations**: If too many context pages are added, especially using the \"URLs and Subpaths\" method, the assistant may miss important information due to reaching its context-page limit.\n\nUnderstanding how to effectively manage context pages is crucial for optimizing the performance of an AI assistant.",

Here’s a quick rundown on how to get started:\n\n### Steps for CSS Customization in Fineguide\n\n1. **Access the Customization Settings**:\n   - Head on over to the **Appearance Tab** in your Fineguide dashboard.\n\n2. **Add Your CSS**:\n   - Look for a section where you can input custom CSS. This is where you’ll be able to write your styles to change the look and feel of your assistant.\n\n3. **Write Your CSS**:\n   - You can target various elements of the chat interface. For example:\n     ```css\n     /* Change the background color of the chat window */\n     .chat-window {\n         background-color: #f0f0f0;\n     }\n\n     /* Customize the text color */\n     .chat-message {\n         color: #333;\n     }\n\n     /* Style the buttons */\n     .chat-button {\n         background-color: #007bff;\n         color: white;\n         border-radius: 5px;\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Preview Your Changes**:\n   - After you’ve added your CSS, make sure to preview the changes to see how they look in action.\n\n5. **Save Your Customizations**:\n   - Once you’re happy with how it looks, don’t forget to save your changes.\n\n### Tips for Effective CSS Customization\n\n- **Use Specific Selectors**: Make sure your CSS selectors are specific enough to override the default styles.\n- **Test Across Devices**: Check how your custom styles look on different devices to ensure a consistent experience.\n- **Keep It Simple**: Sometimes less is more. Don’t go overboard with styles; keep it clean and user-friendly.\n\nIf you run into any snags or need more help, don’t hesitate to holler!

                    "message": "Có, AI có thể đọc và xử lý dữ liệu từ cơ sở dữ liệu JSON. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) là một định dạng dữ liệu phổ biến và dễ dàng để AI phân tích và hiểu. Dưới đây là cách bạn có thể làm điều này:\n\n### Bước 1: Chuẩn Bị Dữ Liệu JSON\nĐảm bảo rằng dữ liệu JSON của bạn có cấu trúc rõ ràng và nhất quán. Ví dụ:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\",\n    \"date_of_birth\": \"1990-01-01\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"name\": \"Jane Smith\",\n    \"email\": \"jane.smith@example.com\",\n    \"date_of_birth\": \"1985-05-15\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Bước 2: Đọc Dữ Liệu JSON\nSử dụng các ngôn ngữ lập trình như Python, JavaScript, hoặc các công cụ hỗ trợ để đọc dữ liệu JSON. Dưới đây là ví dụ bằng Python:\n\n#### Python\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Đọc dữ liệu từ file JSON\nwith open('data.json', 'r') as file:\n    data = json.load(file)\n\n# In dữ liệu ra màn hình\nfor record in data:\n    print(f\"ID: {record['id']}, Name: {record['name']}, Email: {record['email']}, Date of Birth: {record['date_of_birth']}\")\n```\n\n### Bước 3: Xử Lý Dữ Liệu JSON\nSau khi đọc dữ liệu, bạn có thể xử lý và phân tích nó theo nhu cầu của mình. Ví dụ, bạn có thể sử dụng dữ liệu này để huấn luyện mô hình AI hoặc để trả lời các câu hỏi từ người dùng.\n\n#### Ví dụ: Huấn Luyện Mô Hình AI\nBạn có thể sử dụng dữ liệu JSON để huấn luyện mô hình AI. Dưới đây là ví dụ sử dụng thư viện scikit-learn trong Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n\n# Giả sử bạn có dữ liệu JSON chứa các câu hỏi và nhãn\ndata = [\n    {\"question\": \"Làm thế nào để cài đặt phần mềm?\", \"label\": \"Hỗ trợ kỹ thuật\"},\n    {\"question\": \"Tôi muốn biết thêm về sản phẩm A\", \"label\": \"Bán hàng\"},\n    {\"question\": \"Dịch vụ của bạn rất tốt\", \"label\": \"Phản hồi khách hàng\"}\n]\n\n# Tách câu hỏi và nhãn\nquestions = [item['question'] for item in data]\nlabels = [item['label'] for item in data]\n\n# Chuyển đổi câu hỏi thành vector\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer()\nX = vectorizer.fit_transform(questions)\n\n# Huấn luyện mô hình Naive Bayes\nmodel = MultinomialNB()\nmodel.fit(X, labels)\n\n# Dự đoán nhãn cho câu hỏi mới\nnew_question = \"Làm thế nào để mua sản phẩm B?\"\nnew_question_vector = vectorizer.transform([new_question])\npredicted_label = model.predict(new_question_vector)\n\nprint(f\"Câu hỏi: {new_question}\")\nprint(f\"Nhãn dự đoán: {predicted_label[0]}\")\n```\n\n### Bước 4: Tích Hợp AI với Cơ Sở Dữ Liệu JSON\nBạn có thể tích hợp AI với cơ sở dữ liệu JSON để tự động trả lời các câu hỏi từ người dùng hoặc thực hiện các tác vụ khác. Ví dụ, bạn có thể sử dụng Flask để xây dựng một API đơn giản:\n\n#### Flask API\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\nimport json\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Đọc dữ liệu từ file JSON\nwith open('data.json', 'r') as file:\n    data = json.load(file)\n\n@app.route('/get_user', methods=['GET'])\ndef get_user():\n    user_id = request.args.get('id')\n    user = next((item for item in data if item[\"id\"] == int(user_id)), None)\n    return jsonify(user)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Kết Luận\nAI có thể dễ dàng đọc và xử lý dữ liệu từ cơ sở dữ liệu JSON. Bằng cách sử dụng các ngôn ngữ lập trình và công cụ phù hợp, bạn có thể tích hợp AI với dữ liệu JSON để thực hiện các tác vụ như huấn luyện mô hình, trả lời câu hỏi, và nhiều hơn nữa.",

This is ideal for static pages where the content does not change frequently.\n- **URLs and Subpaths:** Use this option if you want the AI assistant to learn from the specified web page and all its subpages. This is useful for dynamic websites or sections of a website where the content is spread across multiple pages.\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n- Each resource added to the context consumes the limited context pages parameter. Depending on your subscription, the learning context might be larger or smaller. Using the 'URLs and Subpaths' method can quickly consume the context limit if the crawler starts to go into numerous subpath pages, potentially leading to incomplete information.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively set up the learning context for your AI assistant, ensuring it has the necessary information to provide accurate and helpful responses.",

This is often labeled as \"DNS Management,\" \"DNS Settings,\" \"DNS Zone File,\" or something similar.\n\n3. **Add a New CNAME Record:**\n   - Look for an option to add a new record. This might be a button labeled \"Add Record,\" \"Create New Record,\" or similar.\n   - Select \"CNAME\" from the list of record types.\n\n4. **Enter the CNAME Details:**\n   - **Name:** Enter the subdomain you want to point to Fineguide. For example, if you want `support.yourdomain.com` to point to Fineguide, enter `support`.\n   - **Value:** Enter the target domain provided by Fineguide. This is the domain you want your subdomain to point to. If Fineguide provided a specific domain for this purpose, use that.\n\n5. **Save the Record:**\n   - Save the new CNAME record. The changes might take some time to propagate across the internet, usually within a few minutes to 24 hours.\n\n### Example:\nIf Fineguide provided you with a target domain like `fineguide.ai`, and you want to create a subdomain `support.yourdomain.com`, you would enter:\n- **Name:** `support`\n- **Value:** `fineguide.ai`\n\n### Contact Support:\nIf you need specific instructions related to Fineguide, I recommend contacting Fineguide support for detailed guidance.

The popup feature streamlines the process, making it user-friendly and effective for maintaining an up-to-date knowledge base.",

This could be a simple answer, a link to more information, or a prompt for further questions.\n\n4. **Test the Keywords**: After setting up the keywords and responses, test the chatbot to ensure it correctly recognizes the keywords and provides the appropriate responses.\n\n5. **Refine and Update**: Monitor the interactions and refine the keywords and responses based on user feedback and common queries that arise.\n\nIf you are using a specific chatbot platform, the exact steps may vary, so it's a good idea to refer to the documentation or support resources for that platform for detailed instructions.",

This ensures that the assistant behaves as expected and provides the desired output.\n- **Unexpected Behavior**: Custom prompts can significantly alter the assistant's behavior, sometimes in unexpected ways. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the instructions you provide and monitor the assistant's responses closely.\n\n### Example Scenario\nIf you want your assistant to always respond with a specific phrase, you can add a custom prompt like `- always respond with \"Hello, how can I help you today?\"`.

Here are the steps you can follow to ensure that the custom picture for the chat icon is maintained:\n\n1. **Access the Chat Window Appearance Settings:**\n   - Log in to your Fineguide account.\n   - From the left menu, click on \"Assistants.\"\n   - Select the assistant you want to customize.\n   - Go to the \"Appearance\" tab.\n\n2. **Upload Your Logo:**\n   - **Assistant Avatar:** Give your assistant a friendly face by going to the \"Assistant Persona\" tab to upload or change the avatar.\n   - **Chat Widget Icon:** This is the icon shown when the chat is minimized. By default, it uses the assistant's avatar, but you can change it. Go to the \"Appearance\" tab and update the image under \"The chat icon when chat is collapsed.\"\n\nMake sure both the avatar and the chat widget icon are set to the desired images. If the issue persists, there might be a bug or a configuration issue that needs further investigation. In such cases, you can open a support ticket from the current chat header or write an email to `support@fineguide.ai` for further assistance.",
