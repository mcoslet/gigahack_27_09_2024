Here’s how it works:\n\n### Bulk Creation for Images:\n1. **Inside the Editor**: Once you make a post and are inside the editor, you can click on the \"bulk create\" option on the left.\n2. **Options Available**:\n   - **Change Design but Keep the Size Same**: Modify the design while maintaining the same dimensions.\n   - **Keep Design Same but Change the Size(s)**: Keep the design consistent but alter the dimensions.\n   - **Change Picture but Keep the Design Same**: Swap out the picture while keeping the design intact.\n   - **Change the 3rd Box**: Useful for adding specific details like a real estate broker's contact information.\n\n### Bulk Creation for Videos:\n1. **Video Variations**: Click on \"video variations\" on the left side of the editor.\n2. **Different Frameworks**: The same product information can be translated into different script/storytelling frameworks.\n3. **Recreated Scenes**: The tool will recreate scenes based on the different frameworks, offering up to 20 variations with a single click.\n\n### Example:\nFor instance, if you are a real estate agent, you can create multiple posts with different property images but the same design template, or you can create various video ads with different scripts but the same visual style.\n\nThis bulk creation feature is particularly useful for businesses that need to produce a large volume of content quickly and efficiently, ensuring consistency across all posts and ads.\n\nWould you like to know more about any specific feature or need assistance with something else?",
