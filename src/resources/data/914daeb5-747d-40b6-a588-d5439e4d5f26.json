This could include user logins, file accesses, system changes, and security incidents.\n\n2. **Configure Audit Policies**: Set up audit policies on your systems to capture the necessary events. This typically involves enabling logging features in operating systems, applications, and network devices.\n\n3. **Log Management**: Ensure that logs are securely stored and protected from unauthorized access. Use centralized log management solutions to collect and store logs from different sources.\n\n4. **Regular Reviews**: Implement a process for regular review of audit logs to detect suspicious activities and ensure compliance with security policies.\n\n5. **Incident Response**: Develop procedures for responding to audit events that indicate potential security incidents.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of your audit policies, procedures, and configurations to ensure transparency and compliance with regulations.\n\nWould you like more detailed information on any of these steps?",
