Here’s a detailed look at what we stand for:\n\n### Declaration of Faith\n\n1. **The Bible**: We believe the Bible is the inspired and only infallible and authoritative written Word of God.\n2. **The Trinity**: We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.\n3. **Jesus Christ**: We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal future return to this earth in power and glory to rule a thousand years.\n4. **Salvation**: We believe in the blessed hope, which is the rapture of the Church of God, at Christ’s coming.\n5. **Regeneration**: We believe that the only means of being cleansed from sin is through repentance and faith in the precious blood of Christ.\n6. **Baptism**: We believe that regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential for personal salvation.\n7. **Sanctification**: We believe in the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a holy life.\n8. **Healing**: We believe that the redemptive work of Christ on the cross provides healing of the human body in answer to believing prayer.\n9. **The Holy Spirit**: We believe in the baptism in the Holy Spirit, according to Acts 2:4, is given to believers who ask for it.\n10. **Resurrection**: We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost, the one to everlasting life and the other to everlasting damnation.\n\nThis declaration encapsulates our commitment to living out the teachings of the Bible and following the example of Jesus Christ in our daily lives.\n\nIs there a particular point you would like to discuss further?",
