Let's break this down to ensure everything is in order.\n\nAccording to the Edgewater Shores bylaws and the general HOA requirements, the notice for the annual meeting must be sent at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the meeting date. For your meeting on September 30th, the second notice should have been sent by September 16th at the latest.\n\nGiven that your management company sent the notice with a postmark date of September 17th, it falls short by one day. This could potentially be an issue as it does not comply with the fourteen-day notice requirement.\n\nHere’s what you might consider:\n\n1. **Verify Receipt Date:** Check if the notices were received by homeowners on or before September 16th. Sometimes mail might be postmarked later but delivered earlier.\n2. **Address the Issue:** If the notice was indeed received late, it would be prudent to address this in your meeting. You might need to reschedule the meeting to comply with the notification requirements.\n3. **Consult Legal Advice:** For a definitive resolution and to avoid any procedural challenges, consulting with your HOA’s legal counsel would be advisable.\n\nWould you like me to assist with any additional information or steps?",
