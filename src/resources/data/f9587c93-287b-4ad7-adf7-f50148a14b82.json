Here is an overview of the process and steps:\n\n### Steps to Obtain a Visa for a Spouse of a U.S. Citizen\n\n1. **Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130)**\n   - **Purpose**: This form establishes the relationship between you (the U.S. citizen) and your spouse (the foreign national).\n   - **Process**: You need to file this form with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Include supporting documents such as your marriage certificate, proof of your U.S. citizenship, and evidence of a bona fide marriage.\n\n2. **Approval of Form I-130**\n   - Once USCIS approves the Form I-130, it will be sent to the National Visa Center (NVC).\n\n3. **National Visa Center (NVC) Processing**\n   - **Purpose**: The NVC handles the pre-processing of the visa application before it is sent to the U.S. embassy or consulate in Brazil.\n   - **Process**: You will need to provide additional documents, pay the required fees, and complete the DS-260 form (Immigrant Visa Application).\n\n4. **Medical Examination and Vaccinations**\n   - Your wife will need to undergo a medical examination by an authorized physician and receive any required vaccinations.\n\n5. **Visa Interview**\n   - **Where**: The interview will be scheduled at the U.S. embassy or consulate in Brazil.\n   - **Purpose**: The consular officer will review the application and documents, and ask questions to determine the validity of the relationship and eligibility for the visa.\n\n6. **Receive Visa**\n   - If the visa is approved, your wife will receive her passport with the visa stamp.\n\n7. **Entry to the United States**\n   - Upon arrival in the U.S., she will need to present her visa and undergo an inspection by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the port of entry.\n\n8. **Adjustment of Status (If Already in the U.S.)**\n   - **Form I-485**: If your wife is already in the U.S. on a different visa, she may apply for Adjustment of Status using Form I-485 to become a lawful permanent resident (Green Card holder).\n\n### Important Considerations\n- **Documentation**: Ensure all documents are accurate and complete to avoid delays.\n- **Fees**: Be aware of the various fees required at each step of the process.\n- **Legal Assistance**: Consider consulting with an immigration attorney to navigate the process more effectively.\n\n### Useful Resources\n- [USCIS Forms](https://www.uscis.gov/forms)\n- [National Visa Center Processing](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/national-visa-center/nvc-processing.html)\n- [USCIS Guide to Naturalization](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/guides/M-618.pdf)\n\nThis process requires careful attention to detail and patience, as it can take several months to complete.

The recognition of a civil union, as opposed to a marriage, can indeed complicate the visa process, as U.S. immigration law generally requires a legally recognized marriage for spousal visa applications.\n\n### Civil Union vs. Marriage in U.S. Immigration Law\n\nU.S. immigration law does not recognize civil unions or domestic partnerships for the purposes of spousal visas. Thus, you would need to be legally married to your spouse for her to qualify for a spousal visa (CR1 or IR1).\n\n### Steps to Take\n\n1. **Marry Legally**\n   - **In Brazil**: You may choose to legally marry your wife in Brazil. Once you have a marriage certificate, you can then proceed with the spousal visa application.\n   - **In the U.S.**: Alternatively, you could bring your wife to the U.S. on a K-1 fiancé(e) visa, marry her within 90 days of her arrival, and then apply for adjustment of status.\n\n2. **K-1 Fiancé(e) Visa Option**\n   - **Petition (Form I-129F)**: File a petition for a K-1 visa. Once approved, your fiancé(e) can enter the U.S. and you must marry within 90 days.\n   - **Adjustment of Status (Form I-485)**: After marriage, apply for adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident.\n\n### Steps to Apply for a Spousal Visa Once Legally Married\n\n1. **Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130)**\n   - File this form with USCIS to establish your marital relationship.\n\n2. **Approval and NVC Processing**\n   - After approval, the case will be sent to the NVC, where you will provide further documents and fees.\n\n3. **Medical Examination, Visa Interview, and Entry**\n   - Complete the medical examination, attend the visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate, receive the visa, and then your wife can enter the U.S.\n\n### Summary\n\nTo proceed, you will need to transition your civil union into a legally recognized marriage. This can be done either in Brazil or via a K-1 fiancé(e) visa to the U.S. Once married, you can then follow the steps to apply for a spousal visa.\n\nIf you have more specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask!",
